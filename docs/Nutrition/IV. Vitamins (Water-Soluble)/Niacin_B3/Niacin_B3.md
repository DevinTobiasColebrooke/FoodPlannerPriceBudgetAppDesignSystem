## Nutrient Functions and Indicators Used to Estimate Requirements

The "Nutrient Functions and the Indicators Used to Estimate the Requirements" (Page 10) section gives insight into the primary biomarkers or functional outcomes used to set the EARs. This helps understand the basis of the values, even if the calculator doesn't directly compute these indicators. For example:

*   **Niacin**: urinary excretion of niacin metabolites, expressed in niacin equivalents (NEs) (allowing for tryptophan conversion). This confirms the need for NE calculation.
