Appendix 2: Estimated Calorie Needs
The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on the person’s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity. In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight, and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed. Estimated amounts of calories needed to maintain energy balance for various age and sex groups at three different levels of physical activity are provided in Table A2-1 for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months and Table A2-2 for ages 2 and older. These estimates are based on the Estimated Energy Requirements (EER) equations, using reference heights (average) and reference weights (healthy) for each age-sex group. For toddlers, children, and adolescents, reference height and weight vary by age. For adults, the reference man is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 154 pounds. The reference woman is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds.
Estimates range from 700 to 1,000 calories for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months. Estimated needs for young children ages 2 through 8 range from 1,000 to 2,000 calories. A wider range of 1,400 to 3,200 calories is estimated for older children and adolescents, with males generally having higher calorie needs than females.
Adult estimated calorie needs range from 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for females and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day for males. As shown, males generally require more calories than females. Due to reductions in basal metabolic rate that occur with aging, calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age.
Estimated calorie needs during the first trimester of pregnancy generally do not increase compared to prepregnancy needs. Additional calories needed for the later trimesters of pregnancy and during lactation are outlined in Table A2-3 and include approximately 300 to 400 additional calories. It is recommended that women follow their healthcare provider’s guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy as many factors, including prepregnancy weight status, gestational weight gain, and multiple pregnancies, may affect calorie needs. Women with overweight or obesity have lower recommended gestational weight gain during pregnancy, which may affect calorie needs.
These calorie needs are only estimates, and approximations of individual calorie needs can be determined with online tools. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals, available at nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator, can be used to estimate calorie needs based on age, sex, height, weight, activity level, and pregnancy or lactation status.

<sup>a</sup> These estimates apply to women with a healthy prepregnancy weight. Women with a prepregnancy weight that is considered overweight or obese should consult their healthcare provider for guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy and lactation.
<sup>b</sup> The EER for the first 6 months of lactation is calculated by adding 500 calories/day to prepregnancy needs to account for the energy needed for milk production during this time period, then subtracting 170 calories/day to account for weight loss in the first 6 months postpartum.
<sup>c</sup> The EER for the second 6 months of lactation is calculated by adding 400 calories/day to prepregnancy needs to account for the energy needed for milk production during this time period. Weight stability is assumed after 6 months postpartum.
Note: Estimates are based on Estimated Energy Requirements (EER) set by the Institute of Medicine.

Appendix 3: USDA Dietary Patterns
The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern (Tables A3-1 and A3-2) is based on the types and proportions of foods Americans typically consume but in nutrient-dense forms and appropriate amounts. The Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern (Tables A3-3 and A3-4) and the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern (Table A3-5) are variations that also exemplify a healthy dietary pattern. For the first time, the Healthy U.S.-Style and Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Patterns are provided for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who are no longer receiving human milk or infant formula. These patterns are designed to meet nutrient needs while not exceeding calorie requirements and while staying within limits for overconsumed dietary components, such as added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.
The methodology used to develop and update these Patterns builds on the rich history USDA has in developing food guides. This methodology includes using current food consumption data to determine the mix and proportions of foods to include in each group. Food composition data is used to select a nutrient-dense representative for each food and calculate nutrient profiles for each food group. As would be expected, most foods in their nutrient-dense forms do contain some sodium and saturated fat. In a few cases, such as in the case of whole-wheat bread, the most appropriate representative in current Federal databases contains a small amount of added sugars. Detailed information about the representative foods, nutrient profiles, and patterns is available in the online appendix of the Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.<sup>1</sup>
Amounts of each food group and subgroup within the patterns are based on nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards (see Appendix 1. Nutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups). Standards for nutrient adequacy aim to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), which are designed to cover the needs of 97 percent of the population, and Adequate Intakes (AI), which are used when an average nutrient requirement cannot be determined. The Patterns meet these standards for almost all nutrients. For a few nutrients (vitamin D and vitamin E for all ages, and choline for ages 2 and older), amounts in the Patterns are marginal or below the RDA or AI standard for many or all age/sex groups. In most cases, an intake of these nutrients below the RDA or AI is not considered to be of public health concern. For more information on dietary components of public health concern, see Chapter 1.
The Patterns have 12 calorie levels to meet the needs of individuals across the lifespan ages 2 and older. For toddlers ages 12 through 23 months, who are no longer receiving either human milk or infant formula, the Patterns are provided at 4 calorie levels. Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe healthy dietary patterns and relevant calorie levels for each life stage. To follow these Patterns, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.

<sup>a</sup> Calorie level ranges: Energy levels are calculated based on median length and body weight reference individuals. Calorie needs vary based on many factors. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals available at nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator/ can be used to estimate calorie needs based on age, sex, and weight.
<sup>b</sup> Definitions for each food group and subgroup and quantity (i.e., cup or ounce equivalents) are provided in Chapter 1 and are compiled in Table A3-2 (footnote c).
<sup>c</sup> All foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms and prepared with minimal added sugars, refined starches (which are a source of calories but few or no other nutrients), or sodium. Food are also lean or in low-fat forms with the exception of dairy, which includes whole-fat fluid milk, reduced-fat plain yogurts, and reduced-fat cheese. There are no calories available for additional added sugars, saturated fat, or to eat more than the recommended amount of food in a food group.
<sup>d</sup> In some cases, food subgroup amounts are greatest at the lower calorie levels to help achieve nutrient adequacy when relatively small number of calories are required.
<sup>e</sup> If consuming up to 2 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best Choices” list in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) joint “Advice About Eating Fish,” available at FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best Choices” list that contain even lower methylmercury: flatfish (e.g., flounder), salmon, tilapia, shrimp, catfish, crab, trout, haddock, oysters, sardines, squid, pollock, anchovies, crawfish, mullet, scallops, whiting, clams, shad, and Atlantic mackerel. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, many commonly consumed varieties of seafood should be avoided because they cannot be consumed at 3 ounces per week by children without the potential of exceeding safe methylmercury limits; examples that should not be consumed include: canned light tuna or white (albacore) tuna, cod, perch, black sea bass. For a complete list please see: FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice.
