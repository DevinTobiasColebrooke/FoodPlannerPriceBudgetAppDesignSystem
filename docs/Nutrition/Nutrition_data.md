Appendix 2: Estimated Calorie Needs

The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on the person's age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity. In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight, and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed. Estimated amounts of calories needed to maintain energy balance for various age and sex groups at three different levels of physical activity are provided in Table A2-1 for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months and Table A2-2 for ages 2 and older. These estimates are based on the Estimated Energy Requirements (EER) equations, using reference heights (average) and reference weights (healthy) for each age-sex group. For toddlers, children, and adolescents, reference height and weight vary by age. For adults, the reference man is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 154 pounds. The reference woman is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds.

Estimates range from 700 to 1,000 calories for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months. Estimated needs for young children ages 2 through 8 range from 1,000 to 2,000 calories. A wider range of 1,400 to 3,200 calories is estimated for older children and adolescents, with males generally having higher calorie needs than females.

Adult estimated calorie needs range from 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for females and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day for males. As shown, males generally require more calories than females. Due to reductions in basal metabolic rate that occur with aging, calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age.

Estimated calorie needs during the first trimester of pregnancy generally do not increase compared to prepregnancy needs. Additional calories needed for the later trimesters of pregnancy and during lactation are outlined in Table A2-3 and include approximately 300 to 400 additional calories. It is recommended that women follow their healthcare provider's guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy as many factors, including prepregnancy weight status, gestational weight gain, and multiple pregnancies, may affect calorie needs. Women with overweight or obesity have lower recommended gestational weight gain during pregnancy, which may affect calorie needs.

These calorie needs are only estimates, and approximations of individual calorie needs can be determined with online tools. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals, available at nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator, can be used to estimate calorie needs based on age, sex, height, weight, activity level, and pregnancy or lactation status.

**Disclosures for Table A2-3:**
<sup>a</sup> These estimates apply to women with a healthy prepregnancy weight. Women with a prepregnancy weight that is considered overweight or obese should consult their healthcare provider for guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy and lactation.
<sup>b</sup> The EER for the first 6 months of lactation is calculated by adding 500 calories/day to prepregnancy needs to account for the energy needed for milk production during this time period, then subtracting 170 calories/day to account for weight loss in the first 6 months postpartum.
<sup>c</sup> The EER for the second 6 months of lactation is calculated by adding 400 calories/day to prepregnancy needs to account for the energy needed for milk production during this time period. Weight stability is assumed after 6 months postpartum.
**Note:** Estimates are based on Estimated Energy Requirements (EER) set by the Institute of Medicine.

Appendix 3: USDA Dietary Patterns

The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern (Tables A3-1 and A3-2) is based on the types and proportions of foods Americans typically consume but in nutrient-dense forms and appropriate amounts. The Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern (Tables A3-3 and A3-4) and the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern (Table A3-5) are variations that also exemplify a healthy dietary pattern. For the first time, the Healthy U.S.-Style and Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Patterns are provided for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who are no longer receiving human milk or infant formula. These patterns are designed to meet nutrient needs while not exceeding calorie requirements and while staying within limits for overconsumed dietary components, such as added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.

The methodology used to develop and update these Patterns builds on the rich history USDA has in developing food guides. This methodology includes using current food consumption data to determine the mix and proportions of foods to include in each group. Food composition data is used to select a nutrient-dense representative for each food and calculate nutrient profiles for each food group. As would be expected, most foods in their nutrient-dense forms do contain some sodium and saturated fat. In a few cases, such as in the case of whole-wheat bread, the most appropriate representative in current Federal databases contains a small amount of added sugars. Detailed information about the representative foods, nutrient profiles, and patterns is available in the online appendix of the *Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee*.<sup>1</sup>

Amounts of each food group and subgroup within the patterns are based on nutrient and *Dietary Guidelines* standards (see Appendix 1. Nutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups). Standards for nutrient adequacy aim to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), which are designed to cover the needs of 97 percent of the population, and Adequate Intakes (AI), which are used when an average nutrient requirement cannot be determined. The Patterns meet these standards for almost all nutrients. For a few nutrients (vitamin D and vitamin E for all ages, and choline for ages 2 and older), amounts in the Patterns are marginal or below the RDA or AI standard for many or all age/sex groups. In most cases, an intake of these nutrients below the RDA or AI is not considered to be of public health concern. For more information on dietary components of public health concern, see Chapter 1.

The Patterns have 12 calorie levels to meet the needs of individuals across the lifespan ages 2 and older. For toddlers ages 12 through 23 months, who are no longer receiving either human milk or infant formula, the Patterns are provided at 4 calorie levels. Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe healthy dietary patterns and relevant calorie levels for each life stage. To follow these Patterns, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.

<sup>a</sup> Calorie level ranges: Energy levels are calculated based on median length and body weight reference individuals. Calorie needs vary based on many factors. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals available at [nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator/](https://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator/) can be used to estimate calorie needs based on age, sex, and weight.
<sup>b</sup> Definitions for each food group and subgroup and quantity (i.e., cup or ounce equivalents) are provided in Chapter 1 and are compiled in Table A3-2 (footnote c).
<sup>c</sup> All foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms and prepared with minimal added sugars, refined starches (which are a source of calories but few or no other nutrients), or sodium. Food are also lean or in low-fat forms with the exception of dairy, which includes whole-fat fluid milk, reduced-fat plain yogurts, and reduced-fat cheese. There are no calories available for additional added sugars, saturated fat, or to eat more than the recommended amount of food in a food group.
<sup>d</sup> In some cases, food subgroup amounts are greatest at the lower calorie levels to help achieve nutrient adequacy when relatively small number of calories are required.
<sup>e</sup> If consuming up to 2 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the "Best Choices" list in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) joint "Advice About Eating Fish," available at [FDA.gov/fishadvice](https://www.fda.gov/fishadvice) and [EPA.gov/fishadvice](https://www.epa.gov/fishadvice). If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the "Best Choices" list that contain even lower methylmercury: flatfish (e.g., flounder), salmon, tilapia, shrimp, catfish, crab, trout, haddock, oysters, sardines, squid, pollock, anchovies, crawfish, mullet, scallops, whiting, clams, shad, and Atlantic mackerel. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, many commonly consumed varieties of seafood should be avoided because they cannot be consumed at 3 ounces per week by children without the potential of exceeding safe methylmercury limits; examples that should not be consumed include: canned light tuna or white (albacore) tuna, cod, perch, black sea bass. For a complete list please see: [FDA.gov/fishadvice](https://www.fda.gov/fishadvice) and [EPA.gov/fishadvice](https://www.epa.gov/fishadvice).

**Disclosures for Table A3-5:**
<sup>a,b,c</sup> See Table A3-2 footnotes. (These refer to the main calorie level notes, food group definitions, and nutrient-dense assumptions from Table A3-2)
<sup>d</sup> Amounts of dairy recommended for children and adolescents are as follows, regardless of the calorie level of the pattern: for age 2 years, 2 cup-eq per day; for ages 3 through 8 years, 2 Â½ cup-eq per day; for ages 9 through 18 years, 3 cup-eq per day.
<sup>e</sup> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide joint advice regarding seafood consumption to limit methylmercury exposure for women who might become or are pregnant or lactating, and children. Depending on body weight, some women and children should choose seafood lowest in methylmercury or eat less seafood than the amounts in the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern. For more information, see the FDA and EPA websites at [FDA.gov/fishadvice](https://www.fda.gov/fishadvice) and [EPA.gov/fishadvice](https://www.epa.gov/fishadvice).
<sup>f</sup> Foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms; lean or low-fat; and prepared with minimal added sugars, refined starches (which are a source of calories but few or no other nutrients), saturated fat, or sodium. If all food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms, a small number of calories remain within the overall limit of the pattern (i.e., limit on calories for other uses). The amount of calories depends on the total calorie level of the pattern and the amounts of food from each food group required to meet nutritional goals. Calories up to the specified limit can be used for added sugars, saturated fat, and/or alcohol (for nonpregnant adults of legal drinking age only) or to eat more than the recommended amount of food in a food group.
**NOTE:** The total dietary pattern should not exceed *Dietary Guidelines* limits for added sugars, saturated fat, and alcohol; be within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and total fats; and stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.

<small><sup>a</sup> All groups except Pregnancy and Lactation are males and females.</small>
<small><sup>b</sup> Criteria upon which the AI was based vary between life stage groups depending on the data available in the literature that were judged to be appropriate. The value for the AI reflects an approximation of the calcium intake that is judged to maintain calcium nutriture based upon all of the information examined. See Table 4-5 for a detailed summary of the specific approaches and data considered for each life stage group. â BMC is the change in bone mineral content. â BMD is the change in bone mineral density.</small>
<small><sup>c</sup> AI = Adequate Intake. The experimentally determined estimate of nutrient intake by a defined group of healthy people. AI is used if the scientific evidence is not available to derive an EAR. For healthy infants fed human milk, AI is an estimated mean intake. Some seemingly healthy individuals may require higher calcium intakes to minimize risk of osteopenia and some individuals may be at low risk on even lower intakes. The AI is believed to cover their needs, but lack of data or uncertainty in the data prevent being able to specify with confidence the percentage of individuals covered by this intake.</small>

**Definitions of Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) Values**

| DRI | Definition |
| :-- | :--------- |
| Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) | The average dietary energy intake that is predicted to maintain energy balance in an adult of a defined age, sex, weight, height, and level of physical activity |
| Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) | The average daily nutrient intake estimated to meet the requirement of half the individuals in a particular sex and life-stage group |
| Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) | The average daily dietary nutrient intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97â98%) individuals in a particular sex and life-stage group |
| Adequate Intake (AI) | The recommended average daily intake based on observed or experimentally determined approximations or estimates of nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of individuals that are assumed to be adequateâused when an RDA cannot be determined |
| Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) | The highest average daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population; as intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse effects may increase |
| Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR) | A range of usual intakes for a macronutrient that is associated with a reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intakes of essential nutrients; an AMDR is expressed as a percentage of total energy intake |
| Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) | DRIs based on chronic disease reference values |

<sup>a</sup> No Tolerable Upper Intake Level is established; however, maximal capacity to excrete excess water in individuals with normal kidney function is approximately 0.7 L/hour.
<sup>b</sup> Total water represents drinking water, water in other beverages, and water (moisture) from food. See Table S-1 for the median percent of total water intake from beverages (including drinking water) and from foods reported in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988â1994).
<sup>c</sup> AI = Adequate Intake. The observed average or experimentally determined intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status, such as growth rate, normal circulating nutrient values, or other functional indicators of health. The AI is used if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to derive an Estimated Average Requirement. The AI is not equivalent to a Recommended Dietary Allowance.

<sup>a</sup> No Tolerable Upper Intake Level is established; however, caution is warranted given concerns about adverse effects when consuming excess amounts of potassium from potassium supplements while on drug therapy or in the presence of undiagnosed chronic disease.
<sup>b</sup> AI = Adequate Intake. The observed average or experimentally determined intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status, such as growth rate, normal circulating nutrient values, or other functional indicators of health. The AI is used if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to derive an Estimated Average Requirement. The AI is not equivalent to a Recommended Dietary Allowance.

NOTE: The EAR can be used to assess the adequacy of nutrient intakes by groups. To do this, one determines the percentage of individuals whose usual intakes are less than the EAR. From this table it can be seen that less than 5 percent of young men have thiamin intakes less than the EAR, but more than half of young women have reported folate intakes less than the EAR. Appendixes G and H allow more accurate estimates of percentages for all age groups than does this excerpted table.

<sup>a</sup> Dietary folate equivalents for the EAR but not for reported dietary intakes. Reported intakes are likely to underestimate true intakes because of limitations of the methods used to analyze the folate content of food (see Chapter 8) and because adjustment has not been made for the higher bioavailability of the folic acid consumed in fortified foods and supplements: 1 dietary folate equivalent = 1 Âµg food folate = 0.6 Âµg of folate from fortified food or as a supplement consumed with food = 0.5 Âµg of a supplement taken on an empty stomach.

<sup>a</sup> UL = maximum level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects. Unless otherwise specified, the UL represents total intake from food, water, and supplements. Because of the lack of suitable data, ULs could not be established for thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, pantothenic acid, or biotin. In the absence of ULs, extra caution may be warranted in consuming levels above recommended intakes.

<sup>b</sup> The ULs for niacin and folate apply to forms obtained from supplements, fortified foods, or a combination of the two.

<sup>c</sup> ND: Not determinable because of lack of data for adverse effects in this age group and concern with regard to lack of ability to handle excess amounts. Source of intake to prevent high levels of intake should be from formula and food only.

Footnotes for Table S-1:
a EAR = Estimated Average Requirement. The intake that meets the estimated nutrient needs of half of the individuals in a group.
b RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance. The intake that meets the nutrient need of almost all (97â98 percent) of individuals in a group.
c AI = Adequate Intake. The observed average or experimentally determined intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status, such as growth rate, normal circulating nutrient values, or other functional indicators of health. The AI is used if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to derive an EAR. For healthy infants receiving human milk, the AI is the mean intake. The AI is not equivalent to an RDA.

Footnotes for Table S-3:
a AI = Adequate Intake. The observed average or experimentally determined intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status, such as growth rate, normal circulating nutrient values, or other functional indicators of health. AI is used if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to derive an Estimated Average Requirement (EAR). For healthy infants receiving human milk, AI is the mean intake. The AI is not equivalent to a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).
b The average chromium content in well balanced diets was determined to be 13.4 Âµg/1,000 kcal and the average energy intake for adults was obtained from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Footnotes for Table S-6:
a EAR = Estimated Average Requirement. The intake that meets the estimated nutrient needs of half of the individuals in a group.
b RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance. The intake that meets the nutrient need of almost all (97â98 percent) of individuals in a group.
c AI = Adequate Intake. The observed average or experimentally determined intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status, such as growth rate, normal circulating nutrient values, or other functional indicators of health. The AI is used if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to derive an EAR. For healthy infants receiving human milk, the AI is the mean intake. The AI is not equivalent to an RDA.

Footnotes for Table S-9:
a EAR = Estimated Average Requirement. The intake that meets the estimated nutrient needs of half of the individuals in a group.
b RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance. The intake that meets the nutrient need of almost all (97â98 percent) of individuals in a group.
c AI = Adequate Intake. The observed average or experimentally determined intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status, such as growth rate, normal circulating nutrient values, or other functional indicators of health. The AI is used if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to derive an EAR. For healthy infants receiving human milk, the AI is the mean intake. The AI is not equivalent to an RDA.

Footnotes for Table S-10:
NOTE: Because of the lack of suitable data, ULs could not be established for vitamin K or chromium. In the absence of ULs, extra caution may be warranted in consuming levels of these nutrients above recommended intakes. Although a UL was not determined for arsenic, there is no justification for adding arsenic to food or supplements. In addition, although silicon has not been shown to cause adverse effects in humans, there is no justification for adding silicon to supplements.
a The highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population. As intake increases above the UL, the risk of adverse effects increases. Unless specified otherwise, the UL represents total nutrient intake from food, water, and supplements.
b ND = not determinable due to lack of data of adverse effects in this age group and concern about lack of ability to handle excess amounts. Source of intake should be from food only to prevent high levels of intake.
c Although vanadium in food has not been shown to cause adverse effects in humans, there is no justification for adding vanadium to food, and vanadium supplements should be used with caution. The UL is based on adverse effects in laboratory animals and this data could be used to set a UL for adults, but not for children or adolescents.

Box S-1 Dietary Reference Intakes
(From p. 3)
Term	Definition
Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)	The average daily dietary nutrient intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all (97 to 98 percent) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group.
Adequate Intake (AI)	The recommended average daily intake level based on observed or experimentally determined approximations or estimates of nutrient intake by a group (or groups) of apparently healthy people that are assumed to be adequateâused when an RDA cannot be determined.
Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)	The highest average daily nutrient intake level that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population. As intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse effects may increase.
Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)	The average daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the requirement of half the healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group.
Calculation Logic with Services:
Core Definitions: These definitions are fundamental to the entire calculator. They dictate how the output of each service is interpreted and used.
DriLookupService: This service will be responsible for storing and retrieving these four types of DRI values (EAR, RDA, AI, UL) for each nutrient, based on age, sex, and special conditions.
All Nutrient Services (e.g., VitaminAService, IronService):
When an EAR is available for a nutrient, the service will typically calculate the RDA using the EAR.
RDA = EAR + 2 SD_EAR (if standard deviation of requirement is known/provided in DRI tables).
RDA = 1.2 Ã EAR (if SD is unknown, assuming a 10% coefficient of variation [CV] for the EAR, as stated on p. 3 of the document).
If an EAR cannot be determined, an AI will be used as the primary intake goal.
NutrientProfileCalculatorService (Orchestrator):
Will receive RDA or AI values from individual nutrient services as the "recommended intake."
Will receive UL values to present as the "safe upper limit."
EARs might be used internally for more advanced probabilistic assessments of inadequacy for groups, but for individual needs, RDA/AI are the targets.

Footnotes for Table S-1 (from p. 8 & p. 9):
a EAR = Estimated Average Requirement. The intake that meets the estimated nutrient needs of half of the individuals in a group.
b RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance. The intake that meets the nutrient need of almost all (97â98 percent) of individuals in a group.
c AI = Adequate Intake. The observed average or experimentally determined intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status... The AI is not equivalent to an RDA.
Calculation Logic with Services (Table S-1 Vitamin A):
DriLookupService: This table's data (EAR, RDA, AI) will be stored, indexed by Life Stage, Sex, and Special Condition (Pregnancy/Lactation).
VitaminAService:
Unit Conversion (RAE): Will retrieve values in Âµg RAE/d. If the calculator allows input of Vitamin A from food composition data in different units (e.g., IU, Âµg retinol, Âµg Î²-carotene), this service (or a UnitConversionService) must convert them to Âµg RAE using the factors:
1 Âµg RAE = 1 Âµg all-trans-retinol
1 Âµg RAE = 12 Âµg Î²-carotene (from food)
1 Âµg RAE = 24 Âµg Î±-carotene or Î²-cryptoxanthin (from food)
(Bioconversion for supplemental Î²-carotene is 2:1 for retinol, so 1 IU supplemental Î²-carotene = 0.15 Âµg RAE).
RDA Calculation: For groups with an EAR, the RDA is likely pre-calculated here based on the document's statement that it's EAR + 2 SD_EAR or 1.2 x EAR. If not, VitaminAService would perform this.
Child Extrapolation: The "Extrapolation from adult EAR" criteria means if these child values weren't pre-tabulated, the service would calculate them from adult EARs using body weight scaling and growth factors (methodology likely detailed in the full Vitamin A chapter or methods chapter, see Table 2-1 later).
Pregnancy/Lactation: These are specific EARs/RDAs to be looked up. The criteria ("plus estimated daily accumulation" or "plus average amount secreted") explain how these DRI values were derived by the IOM committee.
NutrientProfileCalculatorService: Will receive the RDA or AI from VitaminAService as the individual's target intake.

a AI = Adequate Intake... The AI is not equivalent to a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).

DriLookupService: Stores these AI values.
ChromiumService:

The criteria indicate AIs for adults are based on typical energy intakes and an assumed chromium density (13.4 Âµ g/1000 kcal). This logic could be used by the service if more dynamic calculation based on user-provided EER was desired, but the table provides pre-calculated AIs.
Child and pregnancy/lactation values appear to be extrapolations or additions based on specific physiological states.
EnergyRequirementService: While not directly called by ChromiumService for these AI lookups, the EER concept is foundational to how the adult AIs were derived by the IOM.

Calculation Logic with Services (Table S-6 Iron):
DriLookupService: Stores EAR, RDA, AI values.
IronService:
Retrieves EAR and RDA (or AI for young infants).
Factorial Modeling Implied: The criteria "Factorial modeling" indicate that the EARs and RDAs are derived from complex calculations of iron losses (basal, menstrual), growth needs, and absorption rates. The service would likely not redo this entire modeling but would use these final values.
Bioavailability: The EAR/RDA values here assume a certain fractional absorption (e.g., 18% for adults on a typical North American diet, p.13). If the calculator wants to adjust for different dietary patterns (e.g., vegetarian with lower iron bioavailability), IronService would need more complex logic, possibly using different absorption percentages to adjust the dietary iron target. This detail would be in the full Iron chapter.
Skewed Distribution: (p.3) For population assessment, the EAR cut-point method is not ideal for iron. Your individual calculator will primarily use RDAs.

Various Nutrient Services:
When calculating child DRIs via extrapolation from adult DRIs (as mentioned for Vit A, Copper, Iodine, Molybdenum, Zinc, and ULs), these reference weights (Weight_child, Weight_adult) are crucial components of the extrapolation formulas (e.g., EAR_child = EAR_adult Ã (Weight_child/Weight_adult)^0.75 Ã (1 + growth factor)).
The 19-30 y reference weights are applied to all adult age groups if specific weights are not used.

Various Nutrient Services (e.g., VitaminAService, CopperService etc.):
When extrapolating adult EARs to children, the formula EAR_child = EAR_adult Ã F is used, where F = (Weight_child/Weight_adult)^0.75 Ã (1 + growth factor). This table provides the growth factor values.
This table is critical for the child DRI extrapolation logic if your DRI database doesn't already have pre-calculated values for children based on this method.

The 2R-stereoisomeric forms of Î±-tocopherol, as defined in this report, are the only forms of Vitamin E that have been shown to meet human requirements.
<sup>b</sup> All groups except Pregnancy and Lactation are males and females.
<sup>c</sup> EAR = Estimated Average Requirement. The intake that meets the estimated nutrient needs of half of the individuals in a group, men and women combined.
<sup>d</sup> RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance. The intake that meets the nutrient needs of almost all (97â98 percent) individuals in a group.
<sup>e</sup> AI = Adequate Intake. The observed average or experimentally set intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status. An AI is used if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to derive an EAR. For healthy human milk-fed infants, the AI is the mean intake. The AI is not equivalent to an RDA.

<sup>a</sup> The UL is the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population. As intake increases above the UL, the risk of adverse effects increases. Unless specified otherwise, the UL represents total nutrient intake from food, water, and supplements.
<sup>b</sup> The UL for Î±-tocopherol applies to any form of supplemental Î±-tocopherol.
<sup>c</sup> ND. Not determinable due to lack of data of adverse effects in this age group and concern with regard to lack of ability to handle excess amounts. Source of intake should be from food and formula in order to prevent high levels of intake.
