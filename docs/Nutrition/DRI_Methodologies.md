# DRI Methodologies

## Extrapolation for Children
- EAR_child = EAR_adult × F
- Where F = (Weight_child/Weight_adult)^0.75 × (1 + growth factor)
- Growth factors are provided in Table 2-1 (p. 53)
- This is a key implementable logic for child nutrient services

## UL Extrapolation for Children
- UL_child = UL_adult × (Weight_child/Weight_adult)
- Adjusted based on relative body weights
- Values for children are generally lower than adults
- The general UL extrapolation method scales down from adult ULs, usually by body weight

## Pregnancy Needs
Considerations include:
- Obligatory fetal transfer
- Increased maternal needs
- Extrapolation by weight gain (e.g., +16 kg to non-pregnant reference weight for chromium, manganese, molybdenum)
- Specific additions are detailed for:
  - Vitamin A
  - Iron
  - Iodine
  - Copper
  - Zinc
  - Molybdenum

## Lactation Needs
- Non-pregnant requirement + increment for amount secreted in milk
- Adjusted for bioavailability/inefficiencies
- Specific additions detailed for:
  - Vitamin A
  - Iron
  - Iodine
  - Copper
  - Zinc
  - Molybdenum

## Infant AIs
### 0-6 months
- Based on average nutrient intake from human milk
- Average volume: 0.78 L/day

### 7-12 months
- Sum of nutrient from human milk (0.6 L/day) + usual intake from complementary foods
- Or extrapolation from younger infants
