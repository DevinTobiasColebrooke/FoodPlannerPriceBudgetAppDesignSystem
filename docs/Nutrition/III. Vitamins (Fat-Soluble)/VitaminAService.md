# Vitamin A Service

## Units
- Retinol Activity Equivalents (RAE)

## Conversion Factors
- 1 µg RAE = 1 µg all-trans-retinol
- 1 µg RAE = 12 µg β-carotene (from food)
- 1 µg RAE = 24 µg α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin (from food)

Note: The document may later clarify bioconversion from supplements if different, but the summary focuses on dietary. The implication is that twice as much provitamin A carotenoid from food is needed compared to previous assumptions.

## Criteria for EAR/RDA/AI
- Infants (0-12 mo): AI based on human milk
- Adults: Adequate liver vitamin A stores (EAR based)
- Pregnancy/Lactation: Adjustments to female EAR for fetal accumulation/milk secretion

## Values
- Specific EAR, RDA, AI values are provided by life stage group

## UL
- Provided for preformed Vitamin A (e.g., 3,000 µg/d for adults)
