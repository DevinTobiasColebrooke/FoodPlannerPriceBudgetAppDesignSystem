General Notes on Calculation Logic/Formulas:

RDA from EAR:

If Standard Deviation of EAR (SD<sub>EAR</sub>) is known and requirement is normally distributed:
RDA = EAR + 2 SD<sub>EAR</sub> (Page 3, 23)

If SD<sub>EAR</sub> is not well-defined, a Coefficient of Variation (CV<sub>EAR</sub>) of 10% is often assumed:
RDA = EAR + 2 (EAR × 0.1) = EAR (1.2) (Page 3, 24)

If CV<sub>EAR</sub> is assumed to be 15%:
RDA = EAR (1.3) (Page 3)

UL from NOAEL/LOAEL:
UL = NOAEL / UF or UL = LOAEL / UF (Page 66, 68)
Where UF is the Uncertainty Factor.

I. CALCIUM

General Approach: Adequate Intake (AI) is set for all life stages, not EAR/RDA. (Page 5, 12, 48)

Reason for AI not EAR: Uncertainties in balance study methods and significance, lack of concordance between observational and experimental data for desirable calcium retention, and lack of longitudinal data to verify associations with long-term bone health/fracture risk. (Page 7, 50, 91)

Adequate Intake (AI) for Calcium

Specific Inputs/Criteria & Calculation Logic:

Infants (0-6 months):

Input: Average calcium content of human milk (after 1 month lactation) and average human milk intake volume.

Criterion: Mean intake of healthy, exclusively breastfed infants.

Calculation: (Average human milk intake of 780 mL/day) × (Average calcium content of 264 mg/L) = 205.92 mg/day, rounded to 210 mg/day. (Page 93, Table S-1)

Output: AI = 210 mg/day.

Infants (7-12 months):

Input: Average calcium from human milk (600 mL/day at 210 mg/L) + average calcium from solid foods for formula-fed infants.

Criterion: Estimated mean intake from human milk and complementary foods.

Calculation: (600 mL/day × 210 mg/L) + 140 mg/day (from solid foods) = 126 mg + 140 mg = 266 mg/day, rounded to 270 mg/day. (Page 94, Table S-1)

Output: AI = 270 mg/day.

Children (1-3 years):

Input: Extrapolation from 4-8 year olds, aiming for 100 mg/day retention (based on ~20% net retention).

Criterion: Extrapolation of desirable calcium retention from 4 through 8 years.

Calculation: To achieve 100 mg/day retention with ~20% net retention, intake would be 100 / 0.20 = 500 mg/day. (Page 99, Table S-1)

Output: AI = 500 mg/day.

Children (4-8 years):

Input: Calcium accretion data (DXA, body weight), balance studies. Aiming for retention up to 174 mg/day.

Criterion: Calcium accretion / ΔBMC / Calcium balance.

Calculation: An intake of 800-900 mg/day from balance studies leads to mean retention up to 174 mg/day. AI set at 800 mg/day. (Page 98, Table S-1)

Output: AI = 800 mg/day.

Adolescents (9-13 years & 14-18 years):

Input:

Desirable Calcium Retention Model: Based on peak whole body bone mineral accretion (Martin et al., 1997: 282 mg/day for boys, 212 mg/day for girls) + sweat losses (55 mg/day). Solved using nonlinear regression model (Jackman et al., 1997; Appendix E, Figure E-1) on balance data from Greger et al. 1978, Matkovic et al. 1990, Jackman et al. 1997. Results: 1,310 mg/day (boys), 1,070 mg/day (girls).

Factorial Approach: Sum of accretion + losses (urine, feces, sweat) / absorption %. (Table 4-3, Page 102, 104). Results: 1,505 mg/day (boys), 1,276 mg/day (girls).

Clinical Trials: Trials measuring BMC/BMD changes with supplementation. (Table 4-2, Page 102, 103)

Criterion: Desirable calcium retention / Factorial / ΔBMC. (Table S-1)

Calculation: Considering the three lines of evidence, an AI of 1,300 mg/day was judged reasonable for both boys and girls. (Page 105, Table S-1)

Output: AI = 1,300 mg/day.

Adults (19-30 years):

Input:

Desirable Calcium Retention Model: Based on bone mineral accretion during 3rd decade (Peacock, 1991: 50 mg/day males, 10 mg/day females) + sweat losses (63 mg/day). Solved using nonlinear regression model (Jackman et al., 1997; Appendix E, Figure E-2) on balance data (Matkovic and Heaney, 1992). Results: 1,236 mg/day (males), 1,026 mg/day (females).

Factorial Approach: (Table 4-4, Page 108). Results: 1,437 mg/day (males), 1,360 mg/day (females).

Criterion: Desirable calcium retention / Factorial. (Table S-1)

Calculation: Based on desirable retention for women (1,026 mg/day) and with consideration of other methods, AI set at 1,000 mg/day for both genders. (Page 109, Table S-1)

Output: AI = 1,000 mg/day.

Adults (31-50 years):

Input: Balance studies (Heaney et al., 1978; Ohlson et al., 1952), BMD intervention trials (Baran et al., 1990; Elders et al., 1994). Aiming for plateau intake (no net loss).

Criterion: Calcium balance. (Table S-1)

Calculation: Balance data suggest plateau not below 1,000 mg/day. Intervention trials support plateau at or above 1,000 mg/day. AI set at 1,000 mg/day. (Page 110, 111, Table S-1)

Output: AI = 1,000 mg/day.

Adults (51-70 years):

Input: Balance studies in men (Spencer et al., 1984; Figure E-3) aiming for zero balance + sweat loss. Clinical trial data in women (BMD).

Criterion: Desirable calcium retention / Factorial / ΔBMD. (Table S-1)

Calculation: Balance studies in men suggest ~1,000 mg/day. Clinical trials in women show positive effect of >1,000 mg/day. AI set at 1,200 mg/day, assuming needs are somewhat higher than 19-30 due to falling absorption. (Page 111, 114, Table S-1)

Output: AI = 1,200 mg/day.

Adults (>70 years):

Input: Few balance data. Fracture rate and BMD intervention studies (Chapuy et al., 1992; Dawson-Hughes et al., 1997; Recker et al., 1996).

Criterion: Extrapolation of desirable calcium retention from 51-70 year age group / ΔBMD / fracture rate. (Table S-1)

Calculation: Due to too few data to estimate plateau intake, AI set same as 51-70 year olds: 1,200 mg/day. (Page 116, 117, Table S-1)

Output: AI = 1,200 mg/day.

Pregnancy & Lactation (all relevant ages):

Input: Based on AI for non-pregnant/non-lactating state. Maternal skeletal mass not used as reserve. Adaptive maternal responses (enhanced absorption efficiency).

Criterion: Bone mineral mass. (Table S-1)

Calculation: AI is the same as for non-pregnant/non-lactating women of the same age. (Page 121, 127, Table S-1)

Output: AI = 1,300 mg/day (≤18y), 1,000 mg/day (19-50y).

Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for Calcium

Specific Inputs/Criteria & Calculation Logic:

Adults (19 through >70 years, including Pregnancy/Lactation):

Input: Data on Milk-Alkali Syndrome (MAS) (Table 4-10, 4-11).

Criterion: MAS as the critical endpoint.

LOAEL: 5 g/day (total calcium from supplements and food). (Page 138, 141)

UF: 2 (to account for potential increased risk of renal stones and mineral depletion in vulnerable populations). (Page 140, 141)

Calculation: 5 g/day / 2 = 2.5 g/day (2,500 mg/day). (Page 141)

Output: UL = 2,500 mg/day. (Table S-6)

Children & Adolescents (1 through 18 years):

Input: Extrapolated from adult UL, considering risk of mineral depletion with high calcium.

Criterion: Safety, risk of MAS or hyperabsorptive hypercalciuria, mineral depletion.

Calculation: No specific studies, so a conservative UL of 2,500 mg/day (from diet and supplements) is recommended due to lack of data. (Page 141)

Output: UL = 2,500 mg/day. (Table S-6)

Infants (0-12 months):

Input: Lack of data for supplements.

Calculation: Not possible to establish for supplementary calcium. (Page 141)

Output: UL = ND (Not Determinable) for total intake; for supplementary calcium, not possible to establish. Source of intake should be food/formula. (Table S-6)

Calculation (7-12m): (124 mg/L × 0.6 L/day) + 200 mg/day = 74.4 mg + 200 mg = 274.4 mg/day, rounded to 275 mg/day. (Page 162, Table S-2)

Output: AI = 100 mg/day (0-6m), AI = 275 mg/day (7-12m).

Criterion: Accretion + urinary loss / absorption efficiency.

Calculation EAR: (54 mg + 213 mg) / 0.70 (absorption efficiency) = 267 mg / 0.70 = 381.4 mg/day, rounded to 380 mg/day. (Page 164-166, Table S-2)

Calculation RDA: 380 mg × 1.2 = 456 mg/day, rounded to 460 mg/day. (Page 166, Table S-2)

Calculation RDA: 405 mg × 1.2 = 486 mg/day, rounded to 500 mg/day. (Page 169, Table S-2)

Output: EAR = 405 mg/day, RDA = 500 mg/day.

Adolescents (9-13 years & 14-18 years):

Input: Factorial approach. Mean accrued phosphorus (bone + lean tissue, Table 5-5) = 175 mg/day. Urinary loss (using adult equation at 1 g intake) = 565 mg/day.

Criterion: Accretion + urinary loss / absorption efficiency.

Calculation EAR: (175 mg + 565 mg) / 0.70 (absorption efficiency) = 740 mg / 0.70 = 1,057 mg/day, rounded to 1,055 mg/day for both boys and girls. (Page 170-172, Table S-2)

Calculation RDA: 1,055 mg × 1.2 = 1,266 mg/day, rounded to 1,250 mg/day. (Page 172, Table S-2)

Adults (19-30, 31-50, 51-70, >70 years):

Input: Relationship between serum P<sub>i</sub> and absorbed intake (Figure 5-1, Table 5-6). Lower end of normal adult P<sub>i</sub> range (0.87 mmol/L or 2.7 mg/dL) corresponds to an ingested intake of ~580 mg/day.

Criterion: Maintenance of serum P<sub>i</sub> at the lower end of the normal range.

Calculation EAR: Directly from the relationship, EAR = 580 mg/day. (Page 173-175, Table S-2)

Calculation RDA: 580 mg × 1.2 = 696 mg/day, rounded to 700 mg/day. (Page 175, Table S-2)

Output: EAR = 580 mg/day, RDA = 700 mg/day for all adult age groups.

Pregnancy & Lactation (all relevant ages):

Input: Based on EAR/RDA for non-pregnant/non-lactating state. Intestinal absorption increases by ~10% during pregnancy. Lactation needs met by adaptive maternal responses.

Criterion: Fetal growth (pregnancy), maternal needs (lactation).

Calculation EAR/RDA: Same as for non-pregnant/non-lactating women of the same age. (Page 177, 179, Table S-2)

Output: Same as non-pregnant: EAR = 1055 mg (≤18y), 580 mg (19-50y); RDA = 1250 mg (≤18y), 700 mg (19-50y).

NOAEL: 10.2 g/day (ingested intake corresponding to upper limit of normal serum P<sub>i</sub> in infancy, extrapolated to adults, assuming similar tissue safety). (Page 186-187)

UF: 2.5 (due to lack of information on adverse effects between normal and ectopic mineralization levels, and relative lack of human data describing adverse effects of excess intake). (Page 68, 187)

Calculation UL (Adults): 10.2 g/day / 2.5 = 4.08 g/day , rounded to 4.0 g/day (4,000 mg/day). (Page 187, Table S-6)

Calculation UL (Pregnancy): Absorption increases ~15%, so UL is ~15% lower = 3.5 g/day (3,500 mg/day). (Page 188, Table S-6)

IV. VITAMIN D

General Approach: AI for all life stages. Assumes no vitamin D is available from sun-mediated cutaneous synthesis, then value is doubled as a safety factor (except for infants 0-6m).

1 µg cholecalciferol = 40 IU Vitamin D. (Page 18, 255)

Adequate Intake (AI) for Vitamin D

Specific Inputs/Criteria & Calculation Logic:

Infants (0-6 months):

Input: Studies on rickets prevention, serum 25(OH)D levels.

Criterion: Prevention of rickets, maintenance of serum 25(OH)D > 27.5 nmol/L (11 ng/mL).

Calculation: Minimal intake of 2.5 µg (100 IU)/day may prevent rickets but many infants will have 25(OH)D < 27.5 nmol/L. AI set at 5.0 µg (200 IU)/day (this value is not explicitly stated as doubled from a base of 2.5 for this specific age group, but follows the logic for older infants). (Page 264-265, Table S-4)

Output: AI = 5.0 µ g/day .

Infants (7-12 months):

Input: Studies on serum 25(OH)D.

Criterion: Maintenance of serum 25(OH)D > 27.5 nmol/L.

Calculation: In absence of sun, 5 µg (200 IU)/day results in few infants with low 25(OH)D. This is taken as the AI. (Page 266, Table S-4)

Output: AI = 5.0 µ g/day .

Children (1-3 years & 4-8 years):

Input: Extrapolation from older children, data on serum 25(OH)D with low sun exposure.

Criterion: Maintenance of normal serum 25(OH)D.

Calculation: Intake of 2.5 µg (100 IU)/day may be adequate with limited sun. To cover needs regardless of sun, this is doubled to 5.0 µg (200 IU)/day. (Page 267-268, Table S-4)

Output: AI = 5.0 µ g/day .

Adolescents (9-13 years & 14-18 years):

Input: Studies on serum 25(OH)D with low sun exposure.

Criterion: Maintenance of normal serum 25(OH)D (>27.5 nmol/L).

Calculation: Intake of 2.5 µg (100 IU)/day maintained normal 25(OH)D in winter. To cover needs regardless of sun, this is doubled to 5.0 µg (200 IU)/day. (Page 269, Table S-4)

Output: AI = 5.0 µ g/day .

Adults (19-30 years & 31-50 years):

Input: Studies on serum 25(OH)D with low sun exposure (e.g., submariners, vegetarians in Finland).

Criterion: Maintenance of normal serum 25(OH)D (>30 nmol/L).

Calculation: Intake of ~2.5 µg (100 IU)/day from diet (Kinyamu et al., 1997). To cover needs regardless of sun, this base is doubled to 5.0 µg (200 IU)/day. (Page 270-271, Table S-4)

Output: AI = 5.0 µ g/day .

Adults (51-70 years):

Input: Studies on bone loss, serum PTH, and serum 25(OH)D. Intake >5.5 µg (220 IU)/day showed no seasonal PTH variation.

Criterion: Prevention of bone loss, maintenance of normal serum 25(OH)D and PTH.

Calculation: Base of 5 µg (200 IU) was chosen from the range of 2.5 to 17.5 µg. To cover needs regardless of sun, this is doubled to 10.0 µg (400 IU)/day. (Page 272-273, Table S-4)

Output: AI = 10.0 µ g/day .

Adults (>70 years):

Input: Studies on serum 25(OH)D, PTH, bone loss, fracture rates.

Criterion: Maintenance of normal serum 25(OH)D, prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism, reduction of fractures.

Calculation: Base of 7.5 µg (300 IU)/day considered prudent for limited sun exposure. To cover needs regardless of sun, this is doubled to 15.0 µg (600 IU)/day. (Page 273-275, Table S-4)

Output: AI = 15.0 µ g/day .

Pregnancy & Lactation (all relevant ages):

Input: Data on maternal and infant 25(OH)D. No evidence for increased need beyond non-pregnant state if sun exposure is adequate.

Criterion: Maintenance of maternal and infant vitamin D status.

Calculation: Same as for non-pregnant/non-lactating women of the same age. 5.0 µg (200 IU)/day. (Page 276-277, Table S-4)

Output: AI = 5.0 µ g/day .

Specific Inputs/Criteria & Calculation Logic:

Adults (>18 years, including Pregnancy/Lactation):

Input: Studies on serum calcium levels with vitamin D supplementation (Narang et al., 1984).

Criterion: Hypercalcemia.

NOAEL: 60 µg (2,400 IU)/day. (Page 282)

UF: 1.2 (human data, reasonably well-defined NOAEL, but short study duration/small sample considered). (Page 282)

Calculation: 60 µ g/day / 1.2 = 50 µg (2,000 IU)/day. (Page 282-283, Table S-6)

Output: UL = 50 µ g/day .

Children & Adolescents (1 through 18 years):

Input: Extrapolated from adult UL. No specific data for these ages.

Criterion: Hypercalcemia.

Calculation: Same as adult UL: 50 µg (2,000 IU)/day. (Page 285, Table S-6)

Output: UL = 50 µ g/day .

Infants (0-12 months):

Input: Studies on linear growth (Jeans and Stearns, 1938; Fomon et al., 1966).

Criterion: Retarded linear growth.

NOAEL: 45 µg (1,800 IU)/day (mean intake in Fomon study, rounded up). (Page 284)

UF: 1.8 (insensitivity of endpoint, small samples, limited data on tail sensitivity). (Page 68, 284)

Calculation: 45 µ g/day / 1.8 = 25 µg (1,000 IU)/day. (Page 284-285, Table S-6)

Output: UL = 25 µ g/day .

V. FLUORIDE

General Approach: AI for all life stages.

Adequate Intake (AI) for Fluoride

Specific Inputs/Criteria & Calculation Logic:

All ages > 6 months (including Pregnancy/Lactation):

Input: Extensively documented relationship between water fluoride concentration (optimal ~1.0 mg/L) and caries experience. Average dietary intake in optimally fluoridated communities is ~0.05 mg/kg/day.

Criterion: Maximal reduction of dental caries without unwanted side effects (moderate dental fluorosis). (Page 298, 301)

Calculation: 0.05 mg/kg/day × Reference Body Weight for the age/gender group. (Page 302-303, Table S-5)

Infants 7-12m (Ref Wt 9 kg): 0.05 × 9 = 0.45 ≈ 0.5 mg/day.

Children 1-3y (Ref Wt 13 kg): 0.05 × 13 = 0.65 ≈ 0.7 mg/day.

Children 4-8y (Ref Wt 22 kg): 0.05 × 22 = 1.1 ≈ 1 mg/day (rounded for table display).

Children 9-13y (Ref Wt 40 kg): 0.05 × 40 = 2.0 mg/day.

Adolescents 14-18y (Boys, Ref Wt 64 kg): 0.05 × 64 = 3.2 ≈ 3 mg/day.

Adolescents 14-18y (Girls, Ref Wt 57 kg): 0.05 × 57 = 2.85 ≈ 3 mg/day.

Adults >19y (Males, Ref Wt 76 kg): 0.05 × 76 = 3.8 ≈ 4 mg/day.
