NOTE: The EAR can be used to assess the adequacy of nutrient intakes by groups. To do this, one determines the percentage of individuals whose usual intakes are less than the EAR. From this table it can be seen that less than 5 percent of young men have thiamin intakes less than the EAR, but more than half of young women have reported folate intakes less than the EAR. Appendixes G and H allow more accurate estimates of percentages for all age groups than does this excerpted table.

<sup>a</sup> Dietary folate equivalents for the EAR but not for reported dietary intakes. Reported intakes are likely to underestimate true intakes because of limitations of the methods used to analyze the folate content of food (see Chapter 8) and because adjustment has not been made for the higher bioavailability of the folic acid consumed in fortified foods and supplements: 1 dietary folate equivalent = 1 µg food folate = 0.6 µg of folate from fortified food or as a supplement consumed with food = 0.5 µg of a supplement taken on an empty stomach.

<sup>a</sup> UL = maximum level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects. Unless otherwise specified, the UL represents total intake from food, water, and supplements. Because of the lack of suitable data, ULs could not be established for thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, pantothenic acid, or biotin. In the absence of ULs, extra caution may be warranted in consuming levels above recommended intakes.

<sup>b</sup> The ULs for niacin and folate apply to forms obtained from supplements, fortified foods, or a combination of the two.

<sup>c</sup> ND: Not determinable because of lack of data for adverse effects in this age group and concern with regard to lack of ability to handle excess amounts. Source of intake to prevent high levels of intake should be from formula and food only.

Footnotes for Table S-1:
a EAR = Estimated Average Requirement. The intake that meets the estimated nutrient needs of half of the individuals in a group.
b RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance. The intake that meets the nutrient need of almost all (97–98 percent) of individuals in a group.
c AI = Adequate Intake. The observed average or experimentally determined intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status, such as growth rate, normal circulating nutrient values, or other functional indicators of health. The AI is used if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to derive an EAR. For healthy infants receiving human milk, the AI is the mean intake. The AI is not equivalent to an RDA.

Footnotes for Table S-2:
a AI = Adequate Intake. The observed average or experimentally determined intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status, such as growth rate, normal circulating nutrient values, or other functional indicators of health. The AI is used if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to derive an Estimated Average Requirement (EAR). For healthy infants receiving human milk, the AI is the mean intake. The AI is not equivalent to a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).

The observed average or experimentally determined intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status, such as growth rate, normal circulating nutrient values, or other functional indicators of health. The AI is used if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to derive an EAR. For healthy infants receiving human milk, the AI is the mean intake. The AI is not equivalent to an RDA.

Footnotes for Table S-9:
a EAR = Estimated Average Requirement. The intake that meets the estimated nutrient needs of half of the individuals in a group.
b RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance. The intake that meets the nutrient need of almost all (97–98 percent) of individuals in a group.
c AI = Adequate Intake. The observed average or experimentally determined intake by a defined population or subgroup that appears to sustain a defined nutritional status, such as growth rate, normal circulating nutrient values, or other functional indicators of health. The AI is used if sufficient scientific evidence is not available to derive an EAR. For healthy infants receiving human milk, the AI is the mean intake. The AI is not equivalent to an RDA.

Footnotes for Table S-10:
NOTE: Because of the lack of suitable data, ULs could not be established for vitamin K or chromium. In the absence of ULs, extra caution may be warranted in consuming levels of these nutrients above recommended intakes. Although a UL was not determined for arsenic, there is no justification for adding arsenic to food or supplements. In addition, although silicon has not been shown to cause adverse effects in humans, there is no justification for adding silicon to supplements.
a The highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population. As intake increases above the UL, the risk of adverse effects increases. Unless specified otherwise, the UL represents total nutrient intake from food, water, and supplements.
b ND = not determinable due to lack of data of adverse effects in this age group and concern about lack of ability to handle excess amounts. Source of intake should be from food only to prevent high levels of intake.
c Although vanadium in food has not been shown to cause adverse effects in humans, there is no justification for adding vanadium to food, and vanadium supplements should be used with caution. The UL is based on adverse effects in laboratory animals and this data could be used to set a UL for adults, but not for children or adolescents.
