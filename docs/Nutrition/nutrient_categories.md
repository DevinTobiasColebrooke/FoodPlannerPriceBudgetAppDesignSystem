List of Nutrients Covered by the Comprehensive DRI Framework (based on the "Essential Guide" structure):
Based on the structure of the "Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements" and standard nutritional science, here's a list of nutrient categories you'll need to plan for in your database schema and calculator. I'll categorize them for clarity.
I. Energy:
1. Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) - This is what the "Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy" PDF is primarily about.
II. Macronutrients:
2. Carbohydrates:
* Total Carbohydrates (RDA, AMDR)
* Added Sugars (Recommendation for limitation, e.g., <10% of calories from Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which often aligns with DRI considerations)
3. Fiber:
* Total Fiber (AI)
4. Fats (Lipids):
* Total Fat (AI for infants, AMDR for others)
* Saturated Fatty Acids (Recommendation for limitation)
* cis-Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (No specific DRI, but part of total fat)
* cis-Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids:
* n-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (Linoleic Acid - AI, AMDR)
* n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (Alpha-Linolenic Acid - AI, AMDR)
* Trans Fatty Acids (Recommendation for limitation - as low as possible)
5. Cholesterol:
* (Recommendation for limitation - as low as possible, though the emphasis has shifted in recent dietary guidelines)
6. Protein:
* Total Protein (RDA, AMDR)
* Individual Indispensable Amino Acids (EARs and RDAs are established for these, though often simplified to total protein quality for general calculators):
* Histidine
* Isoleucine
* Leucine
* Lysine
* Methionine (+ Cysteine as SAA - Sulfur Amino Acids)
* Phenylalanine (+ Tyrosine as AAA - Aromatic Amino Acids)
* Threonine
* Tryptophan
* Valine
7. Water:
* Total Water (AI)
III. Vitamins (Fat-Soluble):
8. Vitamin A (RAE - Retinol Activity Equivalents; AI or RDA, UL)
9. Vitamin D (IU or µg; AI or RDA, UL)
10. Vitamin E (mg of alpha-tocopherol; RDA, UL)
11. Vitamin K (µg; AI, UL not established or ND)
IV. Vitamins (Water-Soluble):
12. Thiamin (B1) (mg; RDA, UL not established or ND)
13. Riboflavin (B2) (mg; RDA, UL not established or ND)
14. Niacin (B3) (mg NE - Niacin Equivalents; RDA, UL for supplemental forms)
15. Pantothenic Acid (B5) (mg; AI, UL not established or ND)
16. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) (mg; RDA, UL)
17. Biotin (µg; AI, UL not established or ND)
18. Folate (µg DFE - Dietary Folate Equivalents; RDA, UL for synthetic folic acid)
19. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) (µg; RDA, UL not established or ND)
20. Choline (mg; AI, UL)
21. Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) (mg; RDA, UL)
V. Minerals (Major Minerals):
22. Calcium (mg; AI or RDA, UL)
23. Phosphorus (mg; RDA, UL)
24. Magnesium (mg; RDA, UL from supplemental sources)
25. Sodium (mg; AI, CDRR, UL) - Note: The 2019 DRI report for Sodium introduced the CDRR (Chronic Disease Risk Reduction Intake).
26. Chloride (mg; AI, UL)
27. Potassium (mg; AI, CDRR) - Note: The 2019 DRI report for Potassium introduced the CDRR.
28. Sulfate (No specific DRI value)
VI. Minerals (Trace Minerals):
29. Chromium (µg; AI, UL not established or ND)
30. Copper (µg; RDA, UL)
31. Fluoride (mg; AI, UL)
32. Iodine (µg; RDA, UL)
33. Iron (mg; RDA, UL)
34. Manganese (mg; AI, UL)
35. Molybdenum (µg; RDA, UL)
36. Selenium (µg; RDA, UL)
37. Zinc (mg; RDA, UL)
VII. Other Substances (with some DRI considerations, often ULs or AIs if established):
* Arsenic (UL not established, no justification for adding to food/supplements)
* Boron (UL established)
* Nickel (UL established)
* Silicon (UL not established, no justification for adding to food/supplements)
* Vanadium (UL established for adults, caution advised for supplements)
* Carotenoids (Provitamin A ones contribute to Vitamin A RAE; no separate DRIs for others like Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Lycopene beyond their role as general phytonutrients found in a healthy diet).
