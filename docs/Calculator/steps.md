Here's an outline based on your approach, incorporating common nutrient categories and how they might interact. This will set the stage for you to upload individual studies for each.

Nutrient Calculator: Service-Oriented Outline

I. Core User Inputs (Collected via UI and passed to services):
1. Age (Years, or months for infants/toddlers)
2. Sex (Male, Female, or specific intersex considerations if applicable to DRIs)
3. Height (cm or inches)
4. Weight (kg or lbs)
5. Physical Activity Level (PAL) - (Sedentary, Low Active, Active, Very Active - or a way to calculate this)
6. Special Conditions (Flags):
* Pregnant (Trimester: 1st, 2nd, 3rd)
* Lactating (Months postpartum: 0-6, 7-12)
* Smoker (for Vitamin C, etc.)
* Vegetarian/Vegan (for Iron, B12, Zinc, Protein quality considerations)
* Specific medical conditions (Generally out of scope for a basic calculator, but good to acknowledge if future DRIs consider them)

II. Core Data / Reference Tables (To be stored, likely in database):
1. Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) Tables for:
* Estimated Average Requirements (EARs)
* Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs)
* Adequate Intakes (AIs)
* Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs)
* Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDRs)
* Estimated Energy Requirements (EER) formulas/coefficients
2. These tables will be indexed by: Age group, Sex, Special Condition (Pregnancy/Lactation trimester/month).
3. Food Composition Database (If the calculator will also analyze food intake - this is a bigger step, let's assume for now it's just calculating needs).

III. Main Orchestration Service: NutrientProfileCalculatorService

VIII. Expected Outputs (from NutrientProfileCalculatorService):
* A comprehensive hash or object containing:
* EER (kcal)
* For each Macronutrient: RDA/AI (grams and/or %EER), AMDR (grams and %EER), specific limits (e.g., added sugar, saturated fat).
* For each Vitamin: RDA/AI (in appropriate units), UL.
* For each Mineral: RDA/AI (in appropriate units), UL (and CDRR for Sodium).

IX. Example Data Flow (Simplified for Carbohydrates):

NutrientProfileCalculatorService receives user inputs.

Calls EnergyRequirementService with (age, sex, wt, ht, PAL) -> returns EER (e.g., 2000 kcal).

Calls CarbohydrateService with (age, sex, EER=2000 kcal).

CarbohydrateService calls DriLookupService for Carb RDA/AI based on (age, sex) -> returns 130g RDA.

CarbohydrateService calls DriLookupService for Carb AMDR % -> returns 45-65%.

CarbohydrateService calculates AMDR grams: (0.45 * 2000 / 4) to (0.65 * 2000 / 4).

CarbohydrateService calls DriLookupService for Added Sugar limit % -> returns <10%.

CarbohydrateService calculates Added Sugar limit grams: (0.10 * 2000 / 4).

CarbohydrateService returns its hash of results.

NutrientProfileCalculatorService aggregates this with results from other services.

X. Next Steps for You:

Database Schema for DRI Tables: Design how you'll store the detailed DRI tables (like A1-1 to A3-5 from the PDF you'll be using). Consider tables for age_groups, sexes, special_conditions, nutrients, and a main dri_values table that links them.

Prioritize Nutrients: Decide which nutrients to implement first. Macronutrients and EER are fundamental.

For each nutrient/study you upload:

Identify the specific inputs needed for its calculation.

Document the calculation logic/formulas.

Note any sub-calculations or lookups required (which will inform the methods within its service or helper services).

Define the output units and values (RDA, AI, UL, etc.).

This structure should provide a flexible and maintainable system. As you upload individual studies, you can flesh out the Responsibility and internal logic for each [NutrientName]Service. Good luck!
